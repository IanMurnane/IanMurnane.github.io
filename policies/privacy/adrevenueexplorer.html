    <h1>Privacy Policy - Ad Revenue</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: December 1, 2025</p>
    <p>Welcome to Ad Revenue. Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how the app operates and how information is handled, especially concerning the integrated advertising services.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>1. The App's Core Function and Philosophy</h2>
    <p>The **Ad Revenue** app's purpose is to provide users with aggregated, crowdsourced statistics about ad revenue (eCPM/CPC) across different geographical regions.</p>
    <p>The core philosophy of this app is **privacy by design**. The app itself does not require, request, or store any personal data, user accounts, or persistent identifiers.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>2. Data Collection and Use by the App Developer</h2>

    <h3>Data Collected by You (The App)</h3>
    <p>The **Ad Revenue** app does not directly collect any **Personal Data** (such as names, emails, GPS location, device IDs, photos, etc.) from users.</p>

    <h3>Data Use (Aggregated Statistics)</h3>
    <p>The app requires the user to view an advertisement to contribute to the statistics. When an ad is watched, the following **anonymous data** is retrieved from the Ad Network SDK and immediately aggregated with global data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>**Ad Revenue Value:** The estimated revenue generated by that specific ad view (the metric you use to display statistics).</li>
        <li>**Approximate Geographic Region (Country/City Level):** Derived anonymously by the Ad Network SDK.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This aggregated data is the sole basis for the statistics displayed in the app and is not tied back to any individual device or user.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>3. Data Collection by Third-Party Ad Networks</h2>
    <p>To display advertisements, the app integrates a third-party Ad Network SDK (e.g., Google AdMob).</p>
    <p>While the app developer does not collect Personal Data, the **Ad Network Provider** may collect certain data to display targeted or non-targeted ads and to comply with legal requirements (like the GDPR and CCPA).</p>

    <ul>
        <li>**Types of Data Collected by Ad Networks:** The Ad Network may automatically collect non-personal information such as **IP address**, **device type**, **operating system**, and potentially a non-permanent **advertising identifier** (e.g., Google Ad ID or Apple IDFA).</li>
        <li>**Purpose:** This data is used by the Ad Network for purposes including ad serving, ad frequency capping, and ad fraud detection.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The use of data collected by the Ad Network is governed by the Ad Network's privacy policy. Users are often presented with a **Consent Mechanism** (e.g., a GDPR consent dialogue) by the Ad Network prior to receiving personalized ads.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>4. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
    <p>The **Ad Revenue** app itself does not use cookies or local tracking technologies.</p>
    <p>However, the integrated Ad Network SDKs may use cookies or similar tracking technologies on your device to serve advertisements and measure their effectiveness.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>The **Ad Revenue** app is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13. If we become aware that we have inadvertently received personal data from a child under the age of 13, we will promptly delete it.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>6. Data Security and Retention</h2>
    <p>Since the app does not collect or store any Personal Data, there is no Personal Data to secure or retain. The anonymous, aggregated revenue statistics are stored on a secure server for the purpose of maintaining and improving the app's services.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>7. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time to reflect changes to our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. The updated version will be indicated by an updated "Last Updated" date and will be posted on this page.</p>

    <hr>
